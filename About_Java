Java:

1.java is mainly used for "application programming".
    where as c++ is used for the "system programming".
 
 2.Java does not support  "goto" statement.
      where as in c++ supports goto statement.
      
 3.Java does not support multiple inheritance you can achieve through the  interfaces in java
     in c++ supports multiple inheritance.
  
  
  4.java support pointer internally.you can't write pointer program in java.
      in c++ supports pointers.
     
     
  5.Java doesn't support operator overloading
       c++ support operator overloading
      
      
  6.java uses both compiler and interpreter
    Java source code is converted into bytecode at compilation time. 
    the interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and produces output. 
    Java is interpreted that is why it is platform independent.
      

7.Java supports call by value only . There is no call by reference in java.
    in c++ supports both call by vlaue and call by reference.
    
    
 8.Java does not support structures and unions.
       c++ supports structures and unions.
  
 
 9.Java has built in thread support.
            c++ does not support thread.
            
            
            
 10.Java support documentation comment (/** .........*/) to create documentation for java source code.
    
            C++ doesn't support documentation comment.
            
  11.Java has no virtual keyword.we can override all non-static methods by default.
  
  
  12.unsigned right shift(>>>)
        java support unsigned right shift.that fills zero at the top for the negative numbers.
            for positive numbers it works same like >> operator
   
   
  13. Java is not so interactive with hardware.
      c++ is nearer to hardware
      
  14. Java does not support header files like C++. 
        Java uses the import keyword to include different classes and methods.
